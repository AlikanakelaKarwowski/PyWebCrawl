#**PyWebCrawler** is an open source project Tyler and I created to help automate the ticket warranty audit process.


## Instructions:

1. Must have python installed 2.7 or greater
  * If you do not have python installed, goto https://www.python.org/downloads/ and download version 3.8 or higher for your operating system.

2. Add
3. Use `pip install selenium` to install the selenium library.
4. The chrome webdriver is used. place the exe in the folder that pyCrawler-Web.py is located in
  * The chrome driver is for version 79 of chrome. either update or find the original. Its not my problem so don't ask me where to find it
5. Some trial and error may be needed depending on screen resolution and size. run the setup script `python pyMouseSetup.py` and type in the numbers accordingly.
6. Run the program in cmd/powershell/terminal by typing `python .\pyCrawler-Web.py`
7. A new chrome browser will open up to the ticketing site and the program will ask you for your username and password. DONT F*CK THIS UP
8. Do not move the mouse while it is working, Or you'll F*CK  it up.
9. Watch as my little program does the tedious shit for you, sit back, relax and watch netflix or hulu on your phone.
10. This only does 25 entries at a time to reduce the risk of F*CK UPS. Do more at your own risk.
11. Start from the end so no one else works on the same ticket number as you. Its even in the setup.
